## User Story to TDD
As a flight instructor I want to be able to customize a lesson plan for a student.


### Scenario 
From a list of flight maneuvers I can select different ones to add to today's lesson plan. When finished with the selection I can press the done button and be taken to a different page I can share with my student.

### Steps
1. Get all flight maneuvers (From an API/Backend)
2. Display them on screen (list of maneuver names)
3. User selects specific maneuvers
4. User hits done button
5. Selected flight maneuvers are saved locally
6. Selected flight maneuvers are displayed on new screen (with any additional information)
7. User can go back and make changes as needed
